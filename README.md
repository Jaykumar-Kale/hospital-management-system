# 🧠 Counselling Management System

## 📋 Overview : 
The **Counselling Management System** is a full-stack **MERN web application** developed for **Dr. Mansi Karanjakar**, the counsellor at **Pune Institute of Computer Technology (PICT)**.  

The main goal of this project is to provide a digital platform where students can **book counselling appointments**, and counsellors can **manage patient history, session records, and notes** effectively.  

The system is inspired by hospital management platforms but specifically designed for **mental health counselling** needs.  
In the future, the platform will also support **online counselling sessions** and **integration with psychiatrists** to make mental health support more accessible.

 ## 💡Motivation : 

Currently, our college counsellor does not have a dedicated website to manage appointments or student records.

This project was developed to digitalize and simplify the counselling process — making it easier for students to connect, book sessions, and get help in a confidential, organized manner.

It also encourages mental health awareness and provides a step toward integrating technology into student well-being services.
